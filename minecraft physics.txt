Antimatter and matter annhiliate very slowly unless: (antimatter comes in contact with red matter) or (anti-red matter comes in contact with matter) or (red matter comes in contact with anti-red matter)

Red matter is made of strange quarks. Anti-red matter is made of anti-strange quarks.

Red matter comes in contact with antimatter to form black holes. The annihilation favors the destruction of antimatter which results in large amounts of antimatter destroyed by a small amount of red matter.

Strange quarks and anti-strange quarks annihilate to produce gamma rays.

Also, Anti-red matter comes in contact with matter to form black holes. The annihilation favors the destruction of matter which results in large amounts of matter destroyed by a small amount of anti-red matter.

In nuetron stars, the heat and pressure is so intense that the antimatter and matter quickly annihilates. This makes nuetron stars either completely antimatter or completely matter.

Strange quarks are very hard to produce because of the huge size of the strange quark. The only process that can create strange quarks are nuetron collisions. 

Strange quarks interacts with matter by slowly turning them into strange quarks. Similarly, anti-strange quarks interact with  antimatter to turn them into anti-strange quarks.

Modified gravity can allow things to exist between schwarzchild radius and the singularity.

To light a portal requires hard matter forming a frame and heat. Lighting a portal would physically make another portal and fill small gaps in the existing portal. Obsidian and fire creates a nether portal. Bedrock and a lot of lava creates the void. The void teleports things into the singularity. Bedrock and endstone as a heat source creates a portal that teleports into itself which is the mechanism that helps the end dimension from being teleported by the void.
