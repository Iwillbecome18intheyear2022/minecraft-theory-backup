Minecraft theories from The Game Theorists (33 videos): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOl4b517qn8jvCcjb6Bmi7EcK_MnmtPFl

Each of the videos from the youtube playlists can be summerized in less than 200 words. Not all of the 33 videos from The Game Theorists are about Minecraft theories. Most of the game theories video have a large portion of the video repeating things from other videos. The total content is at best worth 9600 words or 200*(15+33) words.

My theories do not rely on any of the other mojang or microsoft produced content or anything related to minecraft fan content. However, some parts refrences to real life, schwarzesmarken, and clockwork planet.

So far I have not found any minecraft theories (from others on the internet) about: "melon", "glistening melon slice", "sharpness enchantment", "smite enchantment", "bane of athropods enchantment", "infinity enchantment", "mending enchantment", "unbreaking enchantment","enchantment incompatibility", "wither skull design on bedrock", "the void", "minecraft world size", "wither half health mode", "origins of bedrock in the end dimension", "origins of endstone", "end crystal", "cave spiders", "endstone", "spawners", "etymology of nether star", "splash potions", "lingering potions", "bottles of enchanting", "quartz", "moon phases", "anvil repair cost increases", "quadratic relationship between experiance levels and experiance points", and "wither skeleton's sword".

But my theory address all of the above.

My theory on blazes, blaze rods, blaze powder, and strength potion relies on "white forces" (a song from fripside). However, there are no other convincing theories about the origin of them. Most other theories claim that blazes were built from "ancient builders". However in the other theories, there are no mention why the blazes were designed that way.

None of my theories rely on the concept of ancient builders.

In the other theories, undead came from a virus. However, in my theories, undead came from a immune system mutation to protect against redstone.

Most minecraft theories theorize that slimes came before magma cubes, but my theory theorize that magma cubes came first.

Both game theories from reddit and youtube comment section theorize that the disks dropped from creepers was because that the creepers wanted to not have the disks to get caught in the players hands or that the skeleton's shot dose not break the disks. I theorize that the disks were suppose to contain "white forces" (a song from fripside) that the ghasts had in their head, and the mechanic was for the creeper to tell the player that it is an opening song. RetroGamingNow believes that the disk dropping were just a game mecahnic. However The Game Theorists youtuber explains that the game mechanic of the music disks dropped from creepers is a refrence to the audio contents of the disks 11 and 13.
