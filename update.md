It took me a long time to write an update. I got sick and then got lazy. On the night between July 13 and 14, I was awake and researching about yttrium nitride because I knew that the chemical formula would be YN which looks like Yoshino Nanjou's initials. After reading that yttrium nitride was soluble in water, I was wishing that yttrium nitride is the only nitride that was soluble in water. Reaction with water does not count. Ammonia is not soluble in water because it reacts to form ammonium oxide. And, ammonium hydroxide is not a nitride. My hope were high. I researched more and end up disappointed. And so, I decide to finish the update.

## How did I thought of the update

On July 4th, I was going to wear bug spray a few minutes later. It made me think about the extermination videos on youtube that I watched about using ozone and carbon monoxide to kill yellow jackets. I wish I could go back and dislike the video because they did not use liquid carbon monoxide and liquid ozone. I thought about how carbon monoxide would be produced. I knew that at high temperatures the equilibrium favors carbon monoxide over carbon dioxide because carbon monoxide has lower molar weight. I had thought about this before, but I thought again this time. I thought about a thing that bind to the carbon monoxide produced. It would not be a catalyst because it would change the equilibrium to favor whatever it could bind to. However, this time I thought about how I can apply this to my minecraft theory because the concept is not present in my theory.


## What is new to my thoery

Redstone increase the duration of potion effects. The reason why is that still has almost the exact same chemical formula as its predecessor, Yoshino Nanjou. When redstone or Yoshino Nanjou is added to a potion, the potion molecules bind to the particles. When the potion gets into someone, Yoshino Nanjou likes to stay inside people, so the effect also stay for longer.

Glowstone dust increase the potency of the potion effects. When glowstone dust is added to a potion, the glowstone dust binds to potion particles which decreases the concentration of the potion particles. Glowstone dust really likes to bind to stuff. This effect can be seen by the fact that glowstone dust is the only powder in minecraft that only needs 4 to make a block. Snowball is not a powder. After the potion particles concentration decreases, the equilibrium favors the production of more potion particles. When the potion enter someone, the glowstone dust stops binding to the potion particles and there are now more potion particles which increase potency.

I have also thought of theories about beacon effects, interaction between glowstone and redstone in brewing, interaction of glowstone and redstone to fire resistance, water breathing, strength, instant damage and instant health potion. However, I believe those theories are too trivial to write about.

## Why did I decide to name the predecessor of redstone as Yoshino Nanjou

I decided to name it Yoshino Nanjou because I thought that Yoshino Nanjou is connected to computer science since her initials are Y and N which represent yes and no in computer science. Redstone also is connected to computer science. I also knew that the etymology of Yoshino Nanjou is "love" and "south". I knew that it can also mean that a chemical is attracted to the south pole of a magnet. However, at that time, I thought that just Nanjou means that. I thought, at that time, that the readers would think Yoshino etymology is from the green yoshi in mario.

## Why did I decide to use github

Around bed time, I thought about some animation of a ghast getting rid of redstone dust from its system. The fact that the gears were once a minecraft thing but was replaced with redstone, made me imagine the ghast as a clockpunk thing instead of a computer. It made me think about clockwork planet because I had recently been learning the japanese words in clockwork planet OP. After light out, I decided to revisit the comments I made on a minecraft iceberg video. I thought to improve the theory. I stayed up to around 4 am putting more and more replies under a comment that I had made. Tomorrow, the whole day, I thought about the theory. And, the night I stayed until 4 am adding new replies under the comment. It was slow because I was using my phone. Then, I decide to write my ideas in a .txt file to prepare to put more under the comment.  While doing so, I consider other text things to use. I decide I want to use github. The other one was pastebin. The reason why I decided to not use pastebin was because I was thinking that the theory was worthy to send to you, and a pastebin link might end up not passing the spam filter. 


## Why did I decide to base my theory on черные метки and clockwork planet.

Clockwork planet was thought of before I wrote the replies.

I was joking about russian things in the replies on the first day. It reminded me of watching черные метки because episode 4 to 11 I used vpn to watch russian dub on animego. On the second day, I thought that White forces also sounded like a description of ghasts, so I included черные метки on the second day of replying to my comments.

While writing on the .txt file, I decided to change all german words to russian in order to reduce the number of languages.

All the anime that I have ever watched, in order of when I watch them, are Love Live, Clockwork planet, Milky Holmes, Bang Dream, Akuma no Riddle, Girl's last tour, and Schwarzesmarken. I believe that adding more animes to my theory would weaken the theory because there would be too many exceptions. And, I think that that черные метки and clockwork planet are what Yoshino Nanjou is familiar with because she voices the main character in both of the anime and visual novel, and she sings the opening. 

## How did I come up with the minecraft theory

In May of 2022, I had already watched a lot of math videos from eigenchris https://www.youtube.com/@eigenchris/videos 

I was thinking about the minecraft dead sun theory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flGjWc8KF-M

I thought that the theory was not convincing enough. So, I thought about the sun and the moon. The minecraft earth is massive that I believe that the sun and moon should not be real object, or else, they will fall out of the sky. Noticing that the sun and moon are opposites like the rays from a pulsar, I thought about space bending light because of the curvature. I thought that the surface of a hypersphere would be easy to imagine which would mean that the source was once where earth was. So, I made the theory that earth was once a pulsar. The universe expanded while conserving density. The pulsar collapsed into a black hole except for 2 layers. The inner layer split into 2 because of gravitation instability very slowly. The light bends back and creates the illusion of sun and moon. I like my theory because the nether roof and ceiling is explained. The nether travel is explained by the fact that inscribed sphere are smaller. I had trouble with explaining the end.

When I first watched the minecraft iceberg series from RetroGamingNow, it was episode 2. I just had a theory on why the ghast is so big but drops so little. So, I wrote it out. I did not spread it anywhere else because I believe should be up to God if the theory should be spread.
